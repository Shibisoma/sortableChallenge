# Sortable Challenge
My submission for the Sortable coding challenge

#How to Run
1. Clone the repo `git clone git://github.com/Shibisoma/sortableChallenge.git`
2. Run the python script `python sortableChallenge.py`
3. Output will be available in results.txt in the local directory

#Requirements
This script was tested on Python 2.7.6 on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS.  No additional Python packages are required.  I assume listings.txt and products.txt must be in the same folder as the python script.
